# Method overloading 
* Method overloading in Java allows you to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but with different parameter lists.
* This allows you to provide different ways to call a method depending on the parameters passed to it. 
* Method overloading is a form of polymorphism.
* It is also called compile-time Polymorphism or early binding.

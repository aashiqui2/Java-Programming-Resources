* we cannot use this or super in static areas
* super --> Super class instance
* super() -->Explicit call of super class constructor
* super(500)-->explicit call of super class Constructor

In method overriding, visibility of the method -should not be reduced.it can be maintained or it can be increased.

# Same method Signature:
Return Datatype: Same or Covarient return Datatype: 


# Access Modifiers:
private < package-private < protected < public
parent                          Child
Work()(package-private)         work()
                                protected work()
                                public work()

protected work()                protected work()
                                public work()

public work()                   public work()



# Why do we need Method Overriding?
Child wants to have its Own definition.




# Covarient return Datatype:
Visibility should not be reduced

```java
class ShapeBuilder{
ShapeBuilder
public ShapeBuilder build(){
 .....
}
class CircleBuilder extends ShapeBuilder{
... 
@Override
public CircleBuilder build(){
...

}
```


# Covarient return datatye:returning Object:

public int add(){
return no1+no2;
}

# Polymorphism
Overriding :protected:Encapsulation
Covarient:Inheritance

Returning Objects
Passing Object as Argument:


# Primative Dataype:
datatypes is a container:
 int a=10;//10-content :a- reference variable (or) identifier
 int container

class is a template:
class is a container:vaiables,methods:
dataype is a container:
class is a container:
thereFore :
class is a  Datatypes:

# Non-primitive Datatype:
Primitive Dataype:size,range:

# Non-Primitiv Datatypes:
Every class is Non-Primitive Datatype:
String is a class
Calculator
Office

variable:
Object:

int no=5;
variable represents dataypes
Object represent class

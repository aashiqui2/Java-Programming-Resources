super()
used to refer parent class constructor 

super() must be first statement in derived class Constructor 

if a constructor  does not  explicitly invoke  a superclass  constructor  by using super(),the java compiler automatically inserts a acall to the no-argument constructor of the super class 

super() can call both parametric as well as non-parametric constructor depending upon the situation     

super                  
used to refer parent class object  

calling object can be done at any time  

if one does not  explicitly invoke  a superclass static variable or methods by using super keyword,then nothing happens(have to discuss)

it is generally used to access the specific variable of a superclass.

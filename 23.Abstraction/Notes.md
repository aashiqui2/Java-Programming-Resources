abstract method -abstract class:
abstract class -abstract method:
if we have abstarct method in a class then definitely the class is abstract,Recursive is not true.
 We can Maintain an abstarct class without any abstarct methods.


Abstract class cannot be instantiated.

child class object can be created if child class is non abstract class.

abstract class A
{


}

Abstarction-inheritance:
Abstract class not be instantiated.but we can have Constrtctor.Why do we need Constrtctor?
For Child Object Child Object Behaves as Parent Object



public protected package-private(default) private
static  final abstract


Static binding :calling static methods :private method calling:
Early Binding:
 Method calling and method definition




What is interface?
it is a group of related methods with empty bodies.

Interfaces form a contract between the class and the outside world,and this contract is enforced at build time by the compiler.

# Abstraction :
showing only necessary data and hiding unwanted.
method:


An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract —it may or may not 
include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, 
but they can be subclassed. When an abstract class is subclassed, 
the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods
in its parent class.
